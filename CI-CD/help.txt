CI :
to make the docker file that which I have it currently on my project on a cloud service
then it should test flake8 and pytest, check whether it's okay or not.
(warnings are not the matter)

1. create an action (docker)


CD :
transfer the project, which is built earlier (and tested via CI), pushing it to deployment service
it can be a VPS.
